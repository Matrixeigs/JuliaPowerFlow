For any cylindrical rotor synchronous machines, its active power $P$ and reactive power $Q$ are limited by the following constraints:

$$
P^{2} + Q^{2} \leq S_{\max}^{2} \\
P = \frac{E_{q}U_{t}}{X_{d}}\sin \delta \\
Q = \frac{E_{q}U_{t}\cos\delta - U_{t}^{2}}{X_{d}} \\
P_{\min} \leq P \leq P_{\max} \\
\delta_{\min} \leq \delta \leq \delta_{\max} \\
E_{q,\min} \leq E_q \leq E_{q,\max} \\
Q_{\min} \leq Q \leq Q_{\max} 
$$

where:
- $S_{max}$ is the maximum apparent power
- $E_q$ is the internal voltage magnitude
- $U_t$ is the terminal voltage magnitude
- $X_d$ is the direct-axis synchronous reactance
- $\delta$ is the power angle, with $\delta_{max} \leq 60Â°$ typically

The capability region is typically visualized in the QP-plane, with Q on the horizontal axis and P on the vertical axis. The constraints impose the following boundaries:

1. The circle $P^2 + Q^2 = S_{max}^2$ represents the apparent power limit
2. The horizontal lines at $P = P_{max}$ and $P = P_{min}$ represent active power limits
3. The curves defined by $\delta = \delta_{max}$ and $\delta = \delta_{min}$ create additional boundaries

These constraints together form the generator capability region in the QP-plane.
